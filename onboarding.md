## Introduction

Welcome to the Stack Monitoring team! We're so happy that you're here.

This document is a subset of the more comprehensive document for the entire Ingest team
which is located in the [Ingest repo](https://github.com/elastic/ingest-dev/blob/master/onboarding.md).

There, you will find a broad overview of the development practices across the Ingest team. You can
also find links to other documents that talk about how developers work at Elastic.

This document focuses on specifics for the Stack Monitoring team.

## Weekly Meetings

The Stack Monitoring team has one team meeting that takes place weekly on Mondays at 1:30 PM UTC for
30 minutes. If a team member can't attend, recordings are available of each meeting.

If you have items that you would like to discuss with the team, please add them to the meeting agenda
which is present in the calendar invitation.

## Daily communication

As with many teams at Elastic, the majority of communication happens asynchronously. That means that
GitHub is often the preferred means of communication. It's a good idea to watch GitHub notifications
closely and to spend time crafting email filters to manage the amount of GitHub email you might
receive. (It's a lot!)

If an issue can't be resolved via GitHub, often a conversation is had in Slack. We prefer that,
whenever possible, conversations be had in public channels instead of in direct messages. This gives
everybody a chance to particpate and gives those in different timezones a record of what happened.

## Project management

Issues are organized into releases using the [Stack Monitoring Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/elastic/projects/74). What's there are targets and not typically hard deadlines. If an issue does have
a hard deadline, it will be identified as such.

## GitHub labels specific to Stack Monitoring

In the Kibana repo, the label is `:Monitoring`. In Beat it is either `monitoring` or `Stack monitoring`.
In the Logstash repo, the label is `monitoring`.

## Discuss forums

Forums should be monitored and questions answered promptly. The forums are:

[Kibana forum with the Monitoring tag](https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/kibana/monitoring)
[Beats forum with the Monitoring tag](https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/beats/monitoring)
[Logstash forum with the Monitoring tag](https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/logstash/monitoring)
[Elastic forum with the Monitoring tag](https://discuss.elastic.co/tags/c/elasticsearch/monitoring)

Sometimes, issues are not tagged correctly and have nothing to do with Stack Monitoring. There is
not a need to answer those unless you wish.
